# Medal_Standings
 An undergraduate web application project.

To successfully install the web application, we perform the following steps in order:

1) We install the xampp server on the computer (C: \ xampp), which allows us to set up an apache server on our computer.
2) Place the entire my_files folder in the xampp htdocs folder (C: \ xampp \ htdocs \ my_files).
3) After starting the apache server and the MySQL database in xampp, go to the website http: // localhost / phpmyadmin /.
4) Create a new database named olympicgames_db and then go to "Import" and select from the my_db folder, the file medal_results.sql
5) We go to http://localhost/my_files/home.html and we are ready to run our application.
